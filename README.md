FlatFury 2D Unity Multiplayer Game (Test).

Target OS: Android (but also can target PC)
Required version: Unity 2021.3.9f, Visual Studio 2019

This was a test assignment which I have extended a bit.

Main features:
- Use of Unity Gaming Services (Lobby, Netcode, Relay);
- So lobby-based multiplayer game up to 4 players (adjustable in code);
- Support for late-joining clients (actually, it waits only for 2 players and then starts a game, other may join later);
- Fake objects to hide the connection inperfections;
- Random unique colors per users. Each projectile and unit are colored in own player colors.

Core Gameplay:
- Collect coins while attacking your enemies... Or just attack your enemies! Forget about coins, toss them to your witcher!
